# Hold Shift to Check Multiple Checkboxes

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to implement a feature that allows users to check multiple checkboxes by holding the Shift key. It is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Contents
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure and content of the checkboxes.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the checkboxes (if applicable).
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for adding interactivity to the checkboxes.

## HTML Structure
The HTML file contains a series of checkboxes within a container. Users can select multiple checkboxes by holding the Shift key and clicking on the checkboxes.

## JavaScript Functionality
The JavaScript code adds interactivity to the checkboxes. When a user holds the Shift key and clicks on a checkbox, all checkboxes between the last checked checkbox and the current checkbox will be checked.

### Functions
- `handleCheck(e)`: Handles the checking of multiple checkboxes when the Shift key is held.

## Usage
To use this project, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Hold the Shift key and click on the checkboxes to select multiple checkboxes at once.
