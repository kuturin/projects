# Anna Grabska - Personal Website

## Overview
This site is designed to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences as a Junior Frontend & Fullstack Developer. It includes sections about me, my IT projects, articles I have written, and a contact form to get in touch with me. I created it as a training project to demonstrate my skills in creating and structuring a website using HTML, focusing on different sections of a website like the header, footer, navigation, main content, sidebars, etc. The primary goal of this project was to teach me how to structure a website. I focused solely on the structure without styling the website, as styling will be done in separate projects.
